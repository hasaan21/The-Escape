# The-Escape
The Escape is a game built in java swing. The fundamental idea behind my project is to create a game in which there will be a player that has to protect itself from the enemies. The game has two modes i.e. normal and hard. There are different levels that will change with increase of score. Level 10 is the boss level. Itâ€™s a never ending game. The game will over as soon as power of player decreases to zero.

## Description:

**Start:** The game will start with displaying a menu. It contains name of the game and three buttons. The Menu buttons are:
  *	Play: Click to select difficulty for the game.
    *	Normal: To play with normal difficulty.
    *	Hard: To play with hard difficulty.
    *	Back: To go back to main menu.
  *	Help: Click to see instructions regarding game.
  *	Quit: Click to quit game.

**Game Play:** The Normal mode contains basic enemy, fast enemy and a boss enemy for final level. The Hard mode contains hard enemy, fast enemy and a boss enemy for final level. A new enemy will be added to the frame each time level is changed. The level will change with every 500 increase of score. When the player collides with enemy, its power will decrease. The damage effect of basic enemy, fast enemy and boss bullets is same, but the hard enemy has slightly greater damage effect. If player collide with boss, the power will end, and game will over instantly.

**End:** The Game will end when the power of player reaches zero and Game Over frame will be displayed. It will contain score and a Try Again button. Clicking it will take you to main menu.
